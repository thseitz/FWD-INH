### Navigation Structure

**FFC Context as Viewing Filter (NOT Ownership Boundary):**
The FFC selector functions as a **viewing context filter** rather than an ownership boundary. When a user selects "Seitz Family Dashboard," they see:
- Assets owned by personas who are members of the Seitz Family FFC
- Assets that personas have shared/given permission to the Seitz Family FFC
- Aggregated estate values from all visible assets within this FFC context
- Assets remain owned by individual personas, not the FFC

**Primary Navigation - Responsive Behavior:**

**Mobile (≤768px):** 
- Bottom tab navigation with 5 core tabs: Home, Members, Documents, Assets, Reports
- FFC selector in top header with clear family name display
- User avatar and notifications in top-right
- Search accessible via floating search icon

**Desktop (>768px):**
- Top horizontal navigation with pill-style buttons
- FFC selector prominent in top-left after logo
- User menu, notifications, and settings in top-right
- Global search bar integrated into header
- Additional Settings and Admin sections accessible

## User Flows - Complete Epic Coverage

### Flow 1: New Family Circle Creation with First Asset

**User Goal:** Set up a new family circle and add the first asset to begin estate planning

**Entry Points:** 
- Landing page "Get Started" CTA
- Dashboard "Create New Family Circle" (for existing users)

**Success Criteria:** 
- Family circle created with verified owner
- First asset successfully added with appropriate permissions
- Family member invitation sent and pending

    M --> N[Invite Family Member Card]
    N --> O[Member Invitation Form]
    O --> P[Dual-Channel Verification]
    P --> Q[Success Dashboard with Asset & Pending Invitation]
```

#### UI Collection Mask Form Implementation (Step J)

**Dynamic Form Generation for First Asset:**
When users select an asset category (Step I), the system fetches the UI Collection Mask configuration for that asset type and renders a streamlined form showing only mandatory fields for quick asset creation.

**Form Structure:**
1. **Base Asset Fields** (mandatory only):
   - Asset name (text field)
   - Current value (currency field with auto-formatting)
   
2. **Asset Type Fields** (mandatory only):
   - Varies by selected category (e.g., for Real Estate: Property Type enum dropdown, Property Address text field)

**User Experience Benefits:**
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Only 3-5 essential fields visible during onboarding
- **Smart Field Types**: Currency auto-formats, enums show relevant choices
- **Fast Completion**: Core asset information captured in under 2 minutes
- **Progressive Path**: Clear indication that advanced fields can be added later

**Technical Implementation:**
- Single API call: `GET /ui-collection-mask/asset-form/{assetType}?mode=mandatory`
- Form renders dynamically based on field_type configuration
- Real-time validation with field-specific error messages
- Draft save capability if user abandons flow

**Advanced Fields Access:**
After completing the mandatory form, users see a "Add More Details Later" hint card on their dashboard, encouraging them to return and complete optional fields when ready.

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- SMS delivery failure → Voice call backup option
- Email verification timeout → Resend with extended window
- Incomplete asset information → Save as draft card on dashboard
- Permission conflicts → Visual permission matrix with warnings

### Flow 2: Asset Permission Management (Mobile-First)

**User Goal:** Asset owners with edit rights modify who can view a specific family asset

**Entry Points:**
- Asset detail card "Manage Permissions" action (only visible to users with edit rights)
- Asset settings menu for co-owners

**Success Criteria:**
- Permissions updated with clear visual confirmation
- All personas with edit rights notified of changes
- Audit trail created for compliance

**Access Control:** Only personas with edit rights on the asset can access this flow. This includes the original asset creator, co-owners granted edit rights, advisors who set up the account, or Forward concierge team.

    I --> J[Update Applied]
    J --> K[Success Animation]
    K --> L[Updated Permissions Matrix]
    L --> M[Notification Sent to All Edit Rights Holders]
```

### Flow 3: Document Upload with PII Protection

**User Goal:** Upload sensitive financial documents while ensuring automatic PII protection for family viewing

**Entry Points:**
- Asset card "Add Documents" action
- Missing documentation alert card action

**Success Criteria:**
- Document uploaded and processed successfully
- PII automatically detected and masked
- Original and masked versions available with appropriate permissions

    Q -->|View Only| S[Access to Masked Version Only]
    R --> T[Document Viewer with Toggle Option]
    S --> U[Document Viewer - Masked Only]
```

#### PII Processing UX Details

**Upload Experience:**
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Visual drop zone with file type indicators
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time upload progress with encryption status
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple documents processed simultaneously
- **Smart Categorization**: Auto-suggest document types based on filename/content

**Processing States:**
- **Uploading**: Progress bar with encryption confirmation
- **Processing**: AWS Step Functions status with estimated completion time
- **PII Detection**: Visual indicator showing AI analysis in progress
- **Ready**: Completion notification with access level summary

**Permission-Aware Display:**
- **Edit Rights Users**: Toggle between original/masked versions
- **View Only Users**: Seamless access to masked version only
- **Processing Status**: Clear indicators for documents still being processed
- **Error Handling**: Retry options for failed PII detection or processing errors

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Upload failure → Retry with progress preservation
- PII detection timeout → Manual review workflow triggered
- Large file processing → Background processing with notification
- Unsupported file types → Clear error message with supported formats list

### Flow 4: Complete 13 Asset Categories Creation & Management

**User Goal:** Create and manage assets using progressive data collection - starting with essential attributes and expanding to comprehensive details through UI or API enhancement

**Entry Points:** 
- Dashboard "Add Asset" quick action
- Assets screen category-specific "Add" buttons  
- API-driven asset creation (Quillt, Estate Ingestion services)
- Bulk import interface for multiple assets

**Success Criteria:**
- Asset created with **Reduced Attribute Set** (MVP viable)
- Clear indication of **Advanced Attributes** available for enhancement
- Seamless transition between manual entry and API-enhanced data
- Visual progress indicators showing data completeness

**Subtle and Purposeful Animation:** All motion serves a functional purpose - providing feedback, showing relationships, or guiding attention. Animations feel natural and trustworthy, respecting user preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

### Key Animations

- **FFC Context Switch:** Smooth fade transition (300ms, ease-out) with loading skeleton
- **Card Expansion:** Scale transform (250ms, ease-in-out) from summary to detailed view
- **Asset Value Updates:** Gentle number counter animation (500ms, ease-out)
- **Permission Changes:** Color-coded slide animation (200ms, ease-in)
- **Document Upload:** Progress ring with success pulse (150ms, ease-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton shimmer animation (1500ms loop, linear)
- **Search Results:** Staggered appearance animation for result cards
- **Notification Toast:** Slide-in from top with bounce effect (300ms, ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** <2 seconds initial page load on 4G networks
- **Interaction Response:** <100ms response time for all user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all motion elements
- **Search Response:** <200ms for simple queries, <500ms for complex filters
- **Report Generation:** <30 seconds for standard reports, progress indicators for longer operations

### Design Strategies
**Progressive Loading:** Critical financial data loads first with skeleton animations. **Optimized Asset Delivery:** Responsive images with lazy loading. **Efficient State Management:** Card-based architecture enables selective updates during FFC context switching. **Search Optimization:** Debounced search with cached results for common queries.
